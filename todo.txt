- fundamental questions
    - raison d'etre
    - web only or web abstracted
    - scope / framework vs. library
    - supported languages (TS / ES6 / ES5)
    - required build / toolchain 
        - try hard to literal tag to act as a "compiler"
        - ES2015+
    - server-side rendering?
    - relation to web components
    - dynamic compilation
    - name / logo / domain
- compiler / syntax
    - general file structure
    - template function markers    
    - expression vs. statement
    - comments
    - component definition
    - event handlers
    - component / directive referencing
    - local references
- basic template syntax
    + static elements
    + interpolation in text nodes
    + properties
    + attributes    
    - one-time binding
    - 2-way data binding
    - loops and trackBy
    + class toggle
    - one vs. multiple text nodes
    - event handlers with event access
    - referencing nodes in a given view
    - sanitization    
- components
    - content projection
        + containers at the root of a slot (can't immediatelly insert)
        + multiple slotables with the same name        
        + conditional slots        
        + conditional slottables (one slottable in a container)
        + conditional slottables (multiple slottables in a container)
        + conditional slottables (slottables in different containers)
        + conditional slottables (slottables in nested containers)
        - mix of named and default nodes in a container
        - re-projection
        - dynamic slottables (loop + track-by)
        - properties binding on slottables
        - imperative (ex.: wrapping in a loop)
        - nested slottables (ex.: tabs)
        - perf: when are content nodes (VNode and DOM) destroyed?
    - host by default? host-less components?
    - dynamic creation
        - basic
        - with inputs / outputs
        - with content
- directives
    - host 
        - bindings
        - other directives
    - listeners / outputs
    - lifecycle and lifecycle hooks
- change detection
    - manual refresh
    - automatic refresh in an event handlers
    - OnPush equivalent
- dynamic insertion of UI fragments (ex. tooltip)
- dynamic compilation (give a string, get a function, a la AngularJS $compile)
- extract "renderer" interface so I can swap one for unit tests and sniff DOM manipulation
