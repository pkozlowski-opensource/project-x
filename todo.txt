- think of the syntax implications for the code I've got so far (prop vs. attr, one-time vs. binding vs. interpolation etc.)
- basic template syntax
    - one-time binding
    - 2-way data binding
    - loops and trackBy
    - class toggle
    - one vs. multiple text nodes
    - comments
    - event handlers with event access
- component model
    - content projection
        - multiple slotables with the same name
        - conditional slots
        - conditional slottables
        - containers at the root of a slot (can't immediatelly insert)
        - re-projection
        - nested (ex.: tabs)
        - imperative (ex.: wrapping in a loop)
    - host bindings
    - listeners / outputs
    - referencing nodes in a given view
- extract "renderer" interface so I can swap one for unit tests and sniff DOM manipulation
